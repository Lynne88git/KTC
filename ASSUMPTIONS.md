# Simply VC - Frontend Test

# General Notes:

The minimum requirements for the assignment are complete more or less? However, you may have to be the judge here.

Products are displaying in the Store section (set to show up as the main page) and search functionality is working fine.
I could spend more hours making this look extra good though. Especially the media queries bit.

I spent some time structuring the product and setting it up with webpack, just because I pretty much enjoy doing that.

I've started adding an additional 'Add to cart' feature (which wasn't required as a minimum) but it will take a bit more time to complete. (For now the cart just pops out a side section where the products you add would show up)

I would also have liked to add an additional feature that allows the products to pop up with more information when the user selects them.

# Additional Note:

This is my first time writing tests and using Jest. I need a little more practice with that.

# Final Note:

Overall, thank you! This was fun! I enjoy doing builds, even though I'm dead tired and my pillows are calling me at this point. ^^

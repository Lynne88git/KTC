# Simply VC - Frontend Test

## Context
You have been hired to develop an online shop from scratch. After a meeting with the stakeholders to better understand the project's scope, the PO came up with the following requirements for the first iteration:

- A grid displaying the products, so the users can browse and check what's available
- An input search, so that the user can type and _filter_ the products

Below you may find a wireframe demonstrating what the stakeholders expect as the outcome of **Iteration 1**.

## Requirements

- A page containing at least the two main elements described above: product gallery + input search.
- Semantic markup (proper use of HTML5).
- Standardized CSS or SCSS (following some standard).
- Modular/reusable code.
- At least one stateful and one stateless component must be present in the solution.
- You must fetch the data from the following public API: https://dummyjson.com/docs/products
- The solution can be coded in the FE framework of your choice (or without framework).
- Unit tests using a tool of your choice. One test case is enough (don't need to go overboard).
- The solution can be developed in JS or TS.

## How and what to submit

By clicking “Accept Assignment” you have created a copy of this repository that is only visible to yourself and ourselves. As a result, all your files that you want to submit, must be inside this repository.

We will be looking for good design choices, functionality and clarity. All you need to do is to commit and push the `master` branch by the deadline, and we will consider this to be the final submission.

It does not matter how many times you commit, branch or revert. All that matters is the state at the last commit in the `master` branch before the deadline.

You are free to ask questions about this assignment by sending an email to <guilherme@simply-vc.com.mt>. Questions asked will be taken into consideration when evaluating the solution. Any assumptions that you make must be included in `ASSUMPTIONS.md`.
